Outputs of model simulations will be found here. These data will be useful for calculations of SSU, MSU, correlations, volc-T, tropical profiles (T, Q, O3), toz.

Examples of model outputs are:
  - CMIP6: to be drawn from, e.g., hist-vol, hist-sol, historical runs.  Original sources may be from
     - ESGF/Pangeo
     - GISS models: https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/giss_cmip6/
         e.g. https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/giss_cmip6/ DAMIP/NASA-GISS/GISS-E2-2-G/hist-sol/r1i1p3f1/AERmon/ toz/gn/v20210911/
     - CCMI: ref-d1/d2
  - ENSO, QBO, AO, NAO indices (pull from CVDP where possible https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/CVC/cvdp/)
  - Global/NH/SH surface air temperature

# contents
Computer programmes for reading/writing input/output data and data analysis will be found here. Examples are:
  - Jupyter notebook for reading GISS ModelE total column ozone outputs and perform linear regression
  - Jupyter notebook for reading and plotting CESM2 data
