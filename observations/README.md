# interconnection-sun-climate
This is where targets/observations for validation are found.  Examples are:
  - Terminator unit conversion (From Robert Leamon)
  - Satellite data (may be obtained using pySat)
      - SSU, MSU
      - SBUV, Basic, SWOOSH
      - TIMED, MLS, AIRS, CrIS, etc....

# Notes

- MSU and SSU data added (UAH, RSS, and NOAA_STAR)
- SAT data added (GISTEMP)
- extraction scripts getXX should work except for SSU/get_noaastar
  (needs nco).
